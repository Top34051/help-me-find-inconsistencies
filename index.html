        <h1 id="introduction">Research Study on Inconsistency Detection in Wikipedia</h1>

        <p>
            Thank you for participating in this research study on inconsistency detection on Wikipedia. In this study,
            we
            will ask you to find inconsistencies in the English Wikipedia with and without the help of our
            chrome extension which will be provided to you. Please read the following details carefully.
        </p>

        <div class="section" id="find-inconsistencies">
            <h2>Help Me Find Inconsistencies!</h2>
            <p>
                Factual inconsistencies in Wikipedia articles occur when information conflicts between different pages.
                This
                can happen when different editors work independently on related topics, or when one article is updated
                with
                new information while another isn't. Identifying these inconsistencies is the first step toward
                resolving
                them.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, even simple conflicts can be challenging to spot, so we have developed a chrome extension
                that highlights potential inconsistencies in Wikipedia articles for editors to review.
            </p>

            <p>Watch this short video to see how the chrome extension works:</p>

            <p>
                The study will be split into two parts. In the first part, you will be given a list of Wikipedia
                articles and asked to find inconsistencies in them without the help of the Chrome extension. In the
                second part, you will be given a different list of articles and asked to find inconsistencies again, but
                this time with the help of the Chrome extension.
